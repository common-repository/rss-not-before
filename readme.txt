RSS Not Before provides the ability to remove posts from the rss feeds prior to a given date.

== Description ==

When importing your blog from blogger you may cause your posts to reappear as duplicates in your subscribers feed readers, unless you install this plugin and set the "Not Before" date to the day you switch. 

This plugin works best if you have already been using feedburner to "burn" your feeds in blogger.

= Why would I use this plugin? =

If you are using blogger and feedburner, then after you import your posts into wordpress and change your feedburner "Original Feed", your subscribers will see all your old posts reappear in their news readers as new unread posts. This plugin allows you to remove all those "old posts" from the rss feed which, after you switch the feedburner feed source, will make the blogger to wordpress transition completely seamless.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `rss-not-before` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
and optionally...
3. Use the blogger import tool to import your posts from blogger.
4. Set the RSS Not Before date to the current date and time.
5. Change the feedburner "Original Feed" to you wordpress feed (http://www.example.com/feed/).
6. Maybe make a new post on your wordpress blog that you have moved your blog.
